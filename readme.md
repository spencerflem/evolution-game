# Evolution Game (Darwin or Lose)
*A multplayer game about population dynamics made for senior-year science research*

## Pitch
Champion a species to greatness! Do you evolve faster speed to catch wiley prey, or intelligence to outsmart predators? How does the herbivore population impact the predators? Population dynamics with pals.


## Context About the Code
This is not an example of clean, readable code.
It was written by and for myself with a tight deadline and no intention of modification after science fair.
Were this a product developed on a team, there would be a significantly better git history, more comments, and no commented out code
With that being said, there are parts I'm still proud of
